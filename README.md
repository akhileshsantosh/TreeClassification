# TreeClassification

Problem statement:

Attached is a dataset which shows the flower classification ML problem. The task is to predict the class of the plant based on certain features given in the excel file. The xlsx has 2 components one showing the variables data and another file showing the explanation of what each of these variables mean.

For this problem, ignore the problem metrics. Ignore the units of tree length like mm or cm. For e.g. do not think that the tree length is in mm or cm. All the measures are metric-less (unit less) and for this problem treat each column in that capacity.

For the dataset, implement the Random Forest classifier using Python. [6M]

The marks distribution is as follows

Import the libraries and Load the dataset and Remove/replace missing values (if any) [1M]
Split features and labels [0.5M]
Split train and test data [0.5M}
Implement Random Forest Classifier [2M]
Calculate accuracy measures [2M]
 

For the same dataset, implement classification with the neural network using Keras in Python. [6M]
